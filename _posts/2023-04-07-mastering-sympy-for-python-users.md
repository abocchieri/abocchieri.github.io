## 1. Introduction to SymPy

SymPy is a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
In this guide, we will cover a wide range of topics, from basic operations to advanced techniques, while providing practical examples and tips to help you fully understand and utilize SymPy's capabilities.
Before diving in, let's address a common question:

- **Q: Why should I choose SymPy over other CAS libraries?**
- A: SymPy offers several advantages over other CAS libraries, such as its pure Python implementation, ease of integration with other Python libraries, and extensive documentation. Moreover, it's open-source and constantly evolving, with an active community of contributors.

With that said, let's start our journey!

<a name="installation"></a>

## 2. Installation and Basic Configuration

First, we need to install SymPy. You can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

Now, let's import SymPy and configure its pretty printing capabilities, which will make our output more readable:

```python
import sympy as sp
sp.init_printing()

```

<a name="expressions"></a>

## 3. Working with Expressions

In SymPy, everything is an expression. To define variables, we use the `symbols` function:

```python
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')

```

Here are some basic examples of expressions and operations:

```python
expr1 = x + y + z
expr2 = x * y * z
expr3 = x**2 + y**2 + z**2

```

To substitute values into an expression, use the `subs` method:

```python
expr1.subs({x: 1, y: 2, z: 3})

```

## 4. Simplification and Expansion

SymPy offers several functions to simplify and expand expressions. Here are some examples:

- `simplify()`: Simplifies an expression.
- `expand()`: Expands an expression.
- `factor()`: Factors an expression.
- `collect()`: Collects common powers of a term in an expression.

```python
expr = (x + y)**2
expanded_expr = sp.expand(expr)
factored_expr = sp.factor(expanded_expr)
```

<a name="calculus"></a>

## 5. Calculus

SymPy provides powerful calculus capabilities, such as differentiation, integration, limits, and series expansion. Here are some examples:

- `diff()`: Differentiates an expression with respect to a variable.
- `integrate()`: Integrates an expression with respect to a variable.
- `limit()`: Computes the limit of an expression as a variable approaches a point.
- `series()`: Expands an expression in a power series.

```python
# Differentiation
f = sp.sin(x)
f_prime = sp.diff(f, x)

# Integration
g = sp.exp(-x**2)
g_integral = sp.integrate(g, x)

# Limits
h = (sp.sin(x) - x) / x**3
h_limit = sp.limit(h, x, 0)

# Series Expansion
i = sp.cos(x)
i_series = i.series(x, 0, 10)
```

## 6. Algebraic Manipulations

SymPy provides various functions for algebraic manipulation, such as simplification, substitution, and equation solving. Here are some examples:

- `simplify()`: Simplifies an expression.
- `subs()`: Substitutes a value or expression for a symbol.
- `solve()`: Solves an equation or system of equations.

```python
expr = x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3*x - 1
simplified_expr = sp.simplify(expr)

sol = sp.solve(expr, x)
```

<a name="equations"></a>

## 7. Solving Equations

SymPy can solve a wide variety of equations, including algebraic, trigonometric, and differential equations. Here are some examples:

- `solve()`: Solves an algebraic equation.
- `solve_trig()`: Solves a trigonometric equation.
- `dsolve()`: Solves a differential equation.

```python

# Algebraic Equation

eq1 = x**2 - 4
sol1 = sp.solve(eq1, x)

# Trigonometric Equation

eq2 = sp.sin(x) + sp.cos(x)
sol2 = sp.solve(eq2, x)

# Differential Equation

y = sp.Function('y')
eq3 = sp.Eq(y(x).diff(x), y(x))
sol3 = sp.dsolve(eq3, y(x))

```

## 8. Linear Algebra

SymPy supports various linear algebra operations, such as matrix operations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Here are some examples:

- `Matrix()`: Creates a matrix.
- `eigenvals()`: Computes the eigenvalues of a matrix.
- `eigenvects()`: Computes the eigenvectors of a matrix.

```python
A = sp.Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = sp.Matrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix addition

C = A + B

# Matrix multiplication

D = A * B

# Eigenvalues

eigenvalues = A.eigenvals()

# Eigenvectors

eigenvectors = A.eigenvects()
```

<a name="discrete-math"></a>

## 9. Discrete Mathematics

SymPy offers functions for working with discrete mathematics, such as combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory. Here are some examples:

- `binomial()`: Computes the binomial coefficient.
- `factorial()`: Computes the factorial of a number. 
- `prime()`: Checks if a number is prime.

```python

# Binomial Coefficient

bc = sp.binomial(5, 2)

# Factorial

fact = sp.factorial(5)

# Prime Number

is_prime = sp.isprime(7)

```

## 10. Physics and Mechanics

SymPy has modules for classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, optics, and thermodynamics. Here are some examples:

- `Lagrangian`: Constructs the Lagrangian for a system of particles.
- `Hamiltonian`: Constructs the Hamiltonian for a system of particles.
- `MatrixOptics`: Performs matrix optics calculations.

```python
from sympy.physics.mechanics import Lagrangian, Particle, Point, ReferenceFrame, dynamicsymbols
from sympy.physics.quantum import Commutator, Dagger, Operator
from sympy.physics.optics import ThinLens, RayTransferMatrix

# Classical Mechanics: Lagrangian

m, g = sp.symbols('m g')
x, v = dynamicsymbols('x v')
N = ReferenceFrame('N')
O = Point('O')
P_pos = O.locatenew('P_pos', x * N.x)
P_pos.set_vel(N, v * N.x)  # Set the velocity of point P_pos in ReferenceFrame N
P = Particle('P', P_pos, m)
L = Lagrangian(N, P) - m * g * x

# Quantum Mechanics: Commutator

A = Operator('A')
B = Operator('B')
commutator = Commutator(A, B)

# Optics: Thin Lens

focal_length = sp.Symbol('f')
lens = ThinLens(focal_length)
transfer_matrix = RayTransferMatrix(lens)
```

```python

x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# 2D Plot

f = sp.sin(x)
sp.plot(f, (x, -2* sp.pi, 2 * sp.pi))

# 3D Plot

g = sp.sin(x) * sp.cos(y)
sp.plotting.plot3d(g, (x, -sp.pi, sp.pi), (y, -sp.pi, sp.pi))
```

<a name="code-generation"></a>

## 12. Code Generation and Optimization

SymPy can generate code in various languages, such as C, Fortran, and Octave, for numerical evaluation of expressions. Here are some examples:

- `lambdify()`: Converts a SymPy expression to a numerical function.
- `codegen()`: Generates code in a specified language.

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy.utilities.codegen import codegen

# Lambdify

f = sp.sin(x) * sp.exp(-x)
f_num = sp.lambdify(x, f, 'numpy')
x_vals = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y_vals = f_num(x_vals)

# Code Generation

f_prime = sp.diff(f, x)
[(c_name, c_code), (h_name, h_code)] = codegen(('f_prime', f_prime), language='C')

```
