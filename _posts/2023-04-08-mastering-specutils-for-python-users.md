## 1. Introduction to Specutils

wide range of tools to manipulate and analyze spectral data. Developed by the Astropy Project, Specutils is built on top of Astropy and is designed to be extensible and easy to use.
In this guide, we will cover various aspects of Specutils, from loading and saving spectra to advanced analysis techniques. We will provide practical examples and tips to help you fully understand and utilize Specutils' capabilities.

<a name="installation"></a>

## 2. Installation and Basic Configuration

First, we need to install Specutils. You can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install specutils
```

Now, let's import Specutils and Astropy units:

```python
import specutils
from astropy import units as u

```

<a name="loading"></a>

## 3. Loading and Saving Spectra

Specutils provides functions for loading and saving spectra from various file formats. Here are some examples:

- Spectrum1D.read(): Reads a spectrum from a file.
- Spectrum1D.write(): Writes a spectrum to a file.

```python
from specutils import Spectrum1D

# Load a spectrum from a FITS file
spectrum = Spectrum1D.read('example_spectrum.fits')

# Save a spectrum to a FITS file
spectrum.write('new_spectrum.fits', format='fits')

```

## 4. Spectral Manipulation

Specutils provides various tools to manipulate and analyze spectra, such as arithmetic operations, continuum subtraction, and spectral resampling. Here are some examples:

- Spectrum1D: Represents a 1D spectrum with its flux and spectral axis data.
- SpectralRegion: Represents a region of interest in a spectrum.
- extract_region(): Extracts a region of interest from a spectrum.
- SpectralResampler: Resamples a spectrum to a new wavelength or frequency grid.

```python
from specutils import Spectrum1D, SpectralRegion
from specutils.manipulation import extract_region, SpectralResampler
import astropy.units as u

# Creating a Spectrum1D object

wavelength = [5000, 5100, 5200] * u.AA
flux = [1, 5, 2] * u.Unit("erg cm-2 s-1 AA-1")
spectrum = Spectrum1D(spectral_axis=wavelength, flux=flux)

# Defining a SpectralRegion

region = SpectralRegion(5050 * u.AA, 5150 * u.AA)

# Extracting a spectral region

sub_spectrum = extract_region(spectrum, region)

# Resampling a spectrum

resampler = SpectralResampler(new_dispersion=[4950, 5050, 5150] * u.AA)
resampled_spectrum = resampler(spectrum)

```

In addition to these basic operations, Specutils offers more advanced tools for spectral analysis and manipulation, such as continuum fitting and normalization, equivalent width measurement, and line profile fitting. These tools will be discussed in the following sections.

## 5. Spectral Analysis

Specutils provides tools for analyzing spectra, such as finding line centers, measuring equivalent widths, and computing moments. Here are some key functions:

- centroid(): Computes the centroid of a spectral feature.
- equivalent_width(): Calculates the equivalent width of a spectral feature.
- line_flux(): Computes the integrated flux of a spectral feature.
- moments(): Calculates the Nth moment of a spectral feature.

<a name="spectral-fitting"></a>

## 6. Spectral Fitting

Specutils includes tools for fitting spectral features with various models, such as Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles. The fit_lines() function allows you to fit one or multiple spectral lines simultaneously.

```python
from specutils.fitting import fit_lines
from astropy.modeling import models

# Example of fitting a Gaussian profile to a spectral line

gaussian_model = models.Gaussian1D(amplitude=1, mean=6563, stddev=10)
fitted_gaussian = fit_lines(spectrum, gaussian_model)

```

## 7. Spectral Features and Line Measurements

Specutils provides various tools to identify and analyze spectral features, such as emission and absorption lines:

- find_lines(): Identifies spectral features in a spectrum.
- estimate_line_parameters(): Estimates line parameters, such as amplitude, center, and width.

## 8. Unit Conversion and Spectral Equivalencies

Specutils makes it easy to work with different units and spectral equivalencies. You can convert between wavelength, frequency, and energy units by using the to() method and the spectral() equivalency.

```python
from astropy.units import spectral

# Convert wavelength to frequency
frequency = wavelength.to(u.Hz, equivalencies=spectral())

# Convert wavelength to energy
energy = wavelength.to(u.eV, equivalencies=spectral())

```

<a name="visualization"></a>

## 9. Visualization

Specutils can be used in combination with matplotlib to visualize spectra:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(spectrum.spectral_axis, spectrum.flux)
plt.xlabel("Wavelength (AA)")
plt.ylabel("Flux (erg cm-2 s-1 AA-1)")
plt.show()

```

## 13. Frequently Asked Questions

- **Q: How do I load a spectrum from a FITS file?**
- A: You can use the Spectrum1D.read() function to load a spectrum from a FITS file.

- **Q: Can I work with multi-dimensional spectra?**
- A: Specutils primarily focuses on 1D spectra, but you can use SpectrumCollection to work with a collection of 1D spectra.
