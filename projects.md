## Exoplanet Missions

### Ariel

[ESA Ariel](https://arielmission.space/) (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Exoplanet Large-survey) is the M4 space mission of the European Space Agency. Ariel will launch in 2029 and will conduct the first spectroscopic survey of the atmospheres of about 1000 diverse exoplanets. With its 1-m class telescope and simultaneous spectral coverage from the visible to the infrared, Ariel will address questions such as: "What are the physical processes shaping planetary atmospheres?", "What are exoplanets made of?" and "How do planets and planetary systems form and evolve?". As chair of several working groups, including the Ariel M1 and Telescope Assembly Tiger Team, the Ariel Simulators Software, Management and Documentation (S2MD) Working Group, and the Ariel Science Brainstorms Working Group, I am fully committed to the success of this mission.

### EXCITE

[EXCITE](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12184/2629373/The-EXoplanet-Climate-Infrared-TElescope-EXCITE/10.1117/12.2629373.short?SSO=1) (The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope) is a balloon-borne spectrograph that will address the limitations of current space-based NIR observatories while complementing and maximizing the science return of JWST. With a 0.5 m-class telescope, EXCITE will measure spectroscopic phase curves of bright, short-period extrasolar giant planets (EGPs, or "hot Jupiters") across the 1–4 micron range. EXCITE will continuously observe each target for a full orbital period and use the resulting phase-resolved spectroscopy to map the planet’s temperature profile and chemical composition as a function of longitude. I am member of the EXCITE team and the EXCITE data analysis working group, where I help evaluate the performance of the mission and the target selection strategy.
