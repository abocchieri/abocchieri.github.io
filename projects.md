[ESA Ariel](https://arielmission.space/) (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Exoplanet Large-survey) is the M4 space mission of the European Space Agency and will operate from the L2 point starting in 2029. Ariel is a dedicated mission for the spectroscopic observation of transiting exoplanets and will conduct the first unbiased survey of a large and diverse sample of approximately 1000 planets in the optical and near-infrared. Key science questions to be addressed by the Ariel mission include: “What are the physical processes shaping planetary atmospheres?”, “What are exoplanets made of?” and “How do planets and planetary systems form and evolve?”.
