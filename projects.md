## Missions:

### Ariel

[ESA Ariel](https://arielmission.space/) (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Exoplanet Large-survey) is the M4 space mission of the European Space Agency and will operate from the L2 point starting in 2029. Ariel is a dedicated mission for the spectroscopic observation of transiting exoplanets and will conduct the first unbiased survey of a large and diverse sample of approximately 1000 planets in the optical and near-infrared. Key science questions to be addressed by the Ariel mission include: “What are the physical processes shaping planetary atmospheres?”, “What are exoplanets made of?” and “How do planets and planetary systems form and evolve?”.

### EXCITE

EXCITE (The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope) is a balloon-borne spectrograph that will address the limitations of current space-based NIR observatories while complementing and maximizing the science return of JWST. With a 0.5 m-class telescope, EXCITE will measure spectroscopic phase curves of bright, short-period extrasolar giant planets (EGPs, or “hot Jupiters”) across the 1–4 μm range. We will continuously observe each target for a full orbital period and use the resulting phase-resolved spectroscopy to map the planet’s temperature profile and chemical composition as a function of longitude.
