I am a postdoctoral researcher in exoplanet science, supervised by Prof. Enzo Pascale, the Ariel mission scientist. I am affiliated to the Department of Physics at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) and [INAF](http://www.inaf.it/it) at [Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri](https://www.arcetri.inaf.it/).

I specialize in **the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets with Ariel**. I have expertise in atmospheric retrieval methods, instrument simulation pipelines, calibration procedures, detrending techniques, and Ariel mission performance analysis.

The ultimate goal of my work is to bridge the gap between instrumentation, observation, and interpretation of astronomical observations.
