I am a Ph.D. candidate in **exoplanet science** in the final year of my three-year program. I am affiliated with the Department of Physics at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) and supervised by Prof. Enzo Pascale, the **Ariel Mission Scientist**.

I specialize in **exoplanet atmospheric characterization with Ariel**. I have expertise in atmospheric retrieval methods, instrument simulation pipelines, calibration procedures, detrending techniques, and Ariel mission performance analysis.

The overarching goal of my research is: **“How do we maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary or atmospheric parameter?”**. This is a fundamental question because to interpret exoplanet data, we select among competing models based on the parameter uncertainties.
