I am Andrea, a young researcher in the exoplanet field currently in the final of a three-year postgraduate program. I work at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) under the supervision of Prof. Enzo Pascale, the Ariel Mission Scientist.

My specific subfield is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with Ariel. I have experience with atmospheric retrievals, end-to-end instrument simulators, calibration, detrending and performance studies of the Ariel mission.
