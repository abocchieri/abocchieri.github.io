I am Andrea, a Ph.D. Candidate at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) where I work under the supervision of Prof. Enzo Pascale, the Ariel Mission Scientist.

In the same University, I got a bachelor degree in Physics in 2018, and in 2020 I graduated with a master degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics (summa cum laude).

<!-- My main research interests are in the exoplanets field and in optics. I focus my efforts on developing new numerical techniques for data analysis and I developed a Python code to study the optical performance of the Ariel Telescope, due for launch in 2029. -->
