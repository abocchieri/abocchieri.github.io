I am a postdoctoral research fellow in **exoplanet science**. I am affiliated with the Department of Physics at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) and mentored by Prof. Enzo Pascale, the **Ariel mission scientist**.

I specialize in **exoplanet atmospheric characterization with Ariel**. I have expertise in atmospheric retrieval methods, instrument simulation pipelines, calibration procedures, detrending techniques, and Ariel mission performance analysis.

The overarching theme of my work is to bridge the gap between instrumentation, observation, and interpretation of astronomical observations.
