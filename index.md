I am a postdoctoral researcher in exoplanet science, supervised by Prof. Enzo Pascale, the mission scientist of Ariel, ESA's mission for the spectroscopic characterization of extrasolar planets. I am affiliated to the [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/) at "Sapienza" University of Rome and [INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri](https://www.arcetri.inaf.it/).

My research area is the characterization of extrasolar planets, pursued by spectroscopic observations from the ground and space, modeling of the spectroscopic observables, data analysis, optimization of space instrumentation, especially optical aspects, and control of experimental systematics. 

I have taken on a responsible role within the Ariel consortium. I coordinate the working group responsible for the mission's scientific performance assessment and the development of innovative data analysis techniques required by the mission. In addition, I moderate the Tiger Team working group formed within the Ariel consortium to develop techniques for measuring large aluminum telescopes for astronomical applications from space.

<!-- I have expertise in atmospheric retrieval methods, instrument simulation pipelines, calibration procedures, detrending techniques, interferometric measurements, and Ariel mission performance analysis. -->

<!-- My work bridges the gap between instrumentation, observation, and interpretation of astronomical observations. -->
