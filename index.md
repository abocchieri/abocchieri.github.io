I am a postdoctoral researcher in exoplanet science, supervised by Prof. Enzo Pascale, the mission scientist of Ariel, ESA's mission for the spectroscopic characterization of extrasolar planets. I am affiliated to the Department of Physics at ["Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/) and [INAF](http://www.inaf.it/it) at [Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri](https://www.arcetri.inaf.it/).

My research field is **the characterization of extrasolar planets**, pursued through spectroscopic observations from ground and space, modelling of the spectroscopic observables, data analysis, optimization of space instrumentation especially optics-related aspects and control of experimental systematics. 

I have taken on a responsible role within the Ariel consortium. I coordinate the working group responsible for the scientific performance assessment of the mission and the development of innovative data analysis techniques required. In addition, I moderate the Tiger Team working group formed within the Ariel consortium to develop techniques for measuring large aluminum telescopes for astronomical applications from space.

<!-- I have expertise in atmospheric retrieval methods, instrument simulation pipelines, calibration procedures, detrending techniques, interferometric measurements, and Ariel mission performance analysis. -->

<!-- My work bridges the gap between instrumentation, observation, and interpretation of astronomical observations. -->
